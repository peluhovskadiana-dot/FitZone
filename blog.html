        <h2>From Couch to Consistency: How to Start a Workout Routine You’ll Stick To
Starting a fitness journey can feel overwhelming—but it doesn’t have to be. The key to lasting results isn’t intense workouts; it’s consistency.

💡 Start Small
Begin with 2–3 workouts per week. Keep it simple: bodyweight exercises, walking, or light cardio. The goal is to build the habit—not burn out.

🎯 Set SMART Goals
Make your goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Example: “Walk 30 minutes, 3 times a week for the next month.”

🔁 Build Habits, Not Just Motivation
Motivation fades—habits stick. Schedule your workouts, prep your gear, and pair exercise with daily routines (like after morning coffee).

📈 Track Progress (Not Just the Scale)
Celebrate small wins like more energy, better sleep, or fitting into clothes more comfortably.

🚫 Don’t Quit After a Setback
Missed a workout? No problem. Get back on track. Fitness is about what you do most of the time—not being perfect.
Takeaway: Start small, stay consistent, and trust the process. You’ve got this.
